Tha main comment I have about the code is I did not notice the get_video function in video_library.py until the end, so could definitely tidy up the rest of the code by replacing the parts where I iterated through the result of get_all_videos
Otherwise, in a few places code was repeated and could probably be refined, but it passed all tests and I'm short on time unfortunately.
